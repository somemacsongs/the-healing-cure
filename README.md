  Welcome to our project, "The Healing Cure" is a website about Medical Cannabis and its benefits.
  
  Have you ever considered Cannabis might help you treat your chronic illness? Many scientists dedicate their lives to studying the benefits of Cannabis-based medical treatments and the results are... awesome. 
  
  This website is a project created during a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at  [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) by Pedro and Lucas, two Brazilian developers who decided to create an interactive database of the many different strains of Medical Cannabis.
